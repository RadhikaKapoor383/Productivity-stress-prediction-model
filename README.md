<b>AI Developer Productivity & Stress Index (AIDPSI) Analysis</b>

This project analyzes the impact of AI-assisted tools on software developer productivity and stress using the AIDPSI dataset, which contains coding, behavioral, and cognitive metrics from 1,000 developers. The study explores how AI usage, cognitive load, sleep, and work habits influence task success, productivity, and stress levels.

We applied machine learning models—Decision Trees for productivity classification and Linear Regression for stress prediction—to identify key factors affecting performance and mental well-being. Findings reveal that moderate AI usage improves productivity, but excessive use combined with high cognitive load increases stress. Behavioral factors, like sleep, also play a critical role.

The results provide actionable insights for organizations to optimize AI tool integration, balance workloads, and support developer mental health, highlighting the importance of data-driven decision-making in modern software engineering.
